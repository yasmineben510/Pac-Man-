 *** START THE GAME ***

The extensions are coded in newer areas, extLevel1 and extLevel2. 
We created a new game extSuperPacman with these new areas. 
They can both be launched in Play.java by using the right name of the class. 
extSuperPacman() for the game with extensions and SuperPacman() for the one with the regular areas but with some minor deviations.
Therefore, to launch the game, run Play.java with the right name of the game you wish to play.

 *** CONTROLS ***

LEFT: go left.
RIGHT : go right.
UP : go up.
DOWN : go down.

§ Level 0 
-  In this level, no pressure. Gain as many points as you like by collecting the diamonds and the cherry.
   However, in order to open the gate that allows the SuperPacman to transit to the next era, you will need to collect the key.
   If you eat the bonus in this level, the ghosts in the next level will be afraid of you for a certain time. 
   So don’t be lazy and not eat it because there are no ghosts in this level.It will help you, believe us.
 
§ Level 1: 
-  Things are getting a little tougher now. If you want to complete this level and transit to the next one, you will need to collect all the diamonds in the area! Yes, you read well.
   It won’t be an easy game, especially when four ghosts are waiting for you! 
   Well, don’t bother with the red ones, they’re not that smart. Just don’t get in their way and you’ll be okay.
   However, beware of the pink and the blue one. Even though they seem friendly, they are worldwide known hunters. 
   If they spot you, it will be hard for you to escape without being eaten! 
   If you want an advice, don’t forget that the bonusses,the flakes and the hearts are your best friends. Once you eat a bonus, the hunters will get scared and flee as fast as they can from you. 
   You will then be able to eat the ghosts! Look how the tables have turned, are we right? 
   (extended version of the game) Collect a flake and the ghosts will freeze temporarily. 
   And when you need a point of life, collecting a heart will help you feel alive again by adding you one point of life.

§ Level 2 : 
-  Now is the real deal. If you made it to this point, let us congratulate you! 
   But seriously, if you pass this level, you will be the supreme SuperPacman player our game has ever faced (That means you will be the winner between three contestants (you and us). What an achievement! Congratulations!). 
   If you want to finish this game, you will need to collect all the diamonds in the area and all the keys as well.
   There are some ghosts trapped inside closed gates. If you collect some keys, the gates will open, not just for you, but for them too. 
   They will be able to hunt you again. Triggers bad memories, right? 
   (Extended version of the game)Don't forget the bonusses, the flakes and the hearts. They are there to help you win against the ghosts.
   Once you collect all the diamonds and keys, you will have finally finished the game!
